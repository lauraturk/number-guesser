### Game Rules

User guesses a number between 1 and 100. The initial range is not apparent, but a guess above or below will prompt the user to stay within the appropriate range.

User must first type a number before any of the buttons are active, and -once they have guessed- can click Clear to guess again or Reset the game to clear the input field, their previous guess, and create a new random number.

A winning guess increases the difficulty of the game by dropping the min range and raising the max range by 10. 

A non-numerical guess or a guess outside of the range returns "NOPE" and prompts for a number within the range.

This game can be played on a desktop as well as on a mobile phone with a screen size larger than 320px.
